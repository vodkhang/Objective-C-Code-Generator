This is my new generation script, mainly copied from here with some improvements to meet my needs:

- Change the dealloc to [self.variable release] instead of [self.variable dealloc];
- Change the @outlet variable to check for the "UI" prefix rather than letting it put IBOutlet everywhere or I have to use 2 scripts at the same time.
- Add some of my own into the assign list
